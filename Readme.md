## Live Demo

### General requirements

Setup your project:

- Create a new directory and initialize it with git.
- Use npm init -y command to create package.json file.
- Create the entry point for your JavaScript code called index.js
- Create index.css file for your styles.
- Create the main index.html file. Link your index.js and index.css files there.
- Create a directory called modules.
- Re-create your Awesome books app following the rules:

- Use ES6 syntax.
    - Divide your code into modules. Save each module in a separate file in the modules dir. Import modules in the index.js file. For this exercise - the more modules the better!
    - Keep all funcionalities of the app without errors.
    - Refactor your methods and functions to arrow functions.
    - Use let and const in a correct way.
    - Display the current date below the navigation bar.

- For this requirement you should use a library [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/install?id=es6)
    - Download the script and save it to your project.
    - Import it as a module.
    - See the article Get the current date and time. Your task here is to use a new tool effectively with little externally curated support. Exactly as you will do in your future job.
